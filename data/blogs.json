If there’s one thing I would never in a million years guessed anyone would ever say about me, it’s “she has great hair!” Let me explain..My hair is naturally curly and fine. Growing up, I hated it!

I also constantly styled it and got really into the whole ombre thing at one point too. (I haven’t dyed my hair in probably 6+ years though!) Naturally, my hair became damaged and unhealthy.
